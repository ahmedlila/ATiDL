# Pre-Text Rotation Detection
> Related to Advanced Topics in Deep Learning (ATiDL) @ Summer 2024 - FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg

This is a personal project to test usecases for Geometric Transformation in a Pre-defined Pretext Task in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) Area. Rotation prediction is chosen based on a simple ConvNet architecture on a [imagenette2](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette) dataset. 


## Getting started!

You can simply install the required libraries using `pip`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

You can simply run the following Python command in the code folder: 
```
python pretext_rotation_detection.py
```

## Loss and Accuracy Curves
- **Time Elapsed:** 55.64 min
- **Epochs:** 15
